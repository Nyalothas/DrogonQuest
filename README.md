Ever questioned what happens to Drogon in season 5 of Game of Thrones? Judging by the way he grew, we suspect he was hunting for goats :)

The game follows the rules of a traditional snake game and contains the functionality for controlling Drogon and score points by eating goats, which will prompt Drogon's tail to grow.

Happy hunting ðŸ™‚!
